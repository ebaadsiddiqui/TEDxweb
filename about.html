        <p>TED - Technology, Entertainment and Design. The story of TED has humble origins, a one-off conference in 1984 about compact disks, e-books and mapping coastlines using fractals. Slowly, the choice of panelists was expanded to include business tycoons, scientists, philosophers, religious and spiritual leaders and many others. TED, now, stands out as one the most unique, creative and intellectual highlights globally. TED also gave birth to a plethora of many sister events - TED-Ed, a medium of education through captivating animations, TEDGlobal - a global conference held at different locations in the world, TED Prize - giving the winner a chance to wish and change the world. Although TED had limited speakers and accepted people only with invites, TED has grown to include and accept all people into its family, continuously inspiring and pushing us forward.</p>
